Sure, here's an example usage description that you can include on your GitHub repository:

## Usage

This tool is designed to scan any executable files, images, URLs, or other files and provide their MD5 and SHA-256 hash values as well as a reputation check on VirusTotal.

To use this tool, you'll need to have Python 3.x and the requests library installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/karankohale/AnoScann.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository using the command:
   ```
   cd <your-repository>
   ```
3. Run the script by executing the following command:
   ```
   python3 AnoScann.py
   ```
   Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to scan.

   For example, to scan a file called "sample.exe" in the current directory, run:
   ```
   python test.py                                            
    ___               _____                      
   /   |  ____  ____ / ___/_________ _____  ____ 
  / /| | / __ \/ __ \\__ \/ ___/ __ `/ __ \/ __ \
